Interviewer: Thanks for meeting with me, Michelle. I'd like to understand your employee onboarding process from start to finish. When does the onboarding process actually begin?

Michelle: So it really starts as soon as we get the signed offer letter back from the candidate. That's when I know they're officially joining and I can kick off all the prep work. Usually we try to have about two weeks between offer acceptance and their start date, but sometimes it's less if they need to start quickly.

Interviewer: What's the first thing you do when you get that signed offer letter?

Michelle: The very first thing is I initiate the background check. We use a third-party service called CheckPoint for that. I log into their portal, enter the candidate's information - name, date of birth, social security number, previous addresses - and submit the request. They usually turn it around in 3 to 5 business days, but sometimes it takes longer if there are issues or if the candidate has lived in multiple states.

Interviewer: What happens if the background check doesn't come back clean?

Michelle: That's rare, but if there's an issue, I have to escalate it to our HR Director and the hiring manager to review. They decide whether to move forward, rescind the offer, or request more information. But like I said, that's maybe 1 out of every 20 hires, so not common. Assuming it comes back clean, I move forward with the rest of the setup.

Interviewer: Okay, so background check is in progress. What's next?

Michelle: Once I submit the background check - I don't wait for it to come back - I go ahead and create the new hire's employee record in our HRIS system. That's Workday for us. I enter all their basic info: name, personal contact info, start date, job title, department, manager name, employment type - like whether they're full-time, part-time, contractor. Their employee ID number gets auto-generated by Workday.

Interviewer: You mentioned employment type. Does that affect the onboarding process?

Michelle: Yeah, definitely. Full-time employees get the whole package - benefits enrollment, company laptop, office workspace, full orientation. Contractors get a more limited setup - they don't get benefits, sometimes they bring their own laptop depending on the contract, and their orientation is shorter. For this conversation, let's focus on full-time employees since that's the majority.

Interviewer: Sounds good. So you've created the employee record in Workday. What happens next?

Michelle: Next I need to notify IT to set up their accounts and equipment. We have a shared email inbox for IT requests - it's helpdesk@company.com - and I send them an email with all the new hire details. Name, start date, department, manager, and whether they're remote or on-site because that affects what equipment they get.

Interviewer: Tell me more about that remote versus on-site decision.

Michelle: Sure. So if they're on-site, IT sends them a laptop and they pick up their monitor, keyboard, mouse, and docking station from the IT equipment room on their first day. If they're remote, IT ships them the full setup - laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, docking station, headset, even a desk chair if they need one. That shipping obviously takes longer, so for remote employees I really need to get that IT request in early, like 10 days before start date at a minimum, to make sure everything arrives on time. We've definitely had situations where remote employees started and their equipment hadn't arrived yet, and that's just a terrible first impression.

Interviewer: That sounds like a pain point. How often does that happen?

Michelle: More often than I'd like to admit. I'd say maybe 1 in 10 remote hires have some kind of equipment delay. Either IT didn't order it in time, or shipping was delayed, or something was out of stock. It's frustrating for everyone - the new hire, the manager, IT, me. We usually have to overnight ship stuff when that happens, which costs extra money.

Interviewer: Got it. So you've notified IT. What else needs to happen before the start date?

Michelle: I also need to notify Facilities if the person is on-site, so they can assign a workspace. That's another email, this time to facilities@company.com. I give them the same basic info - name, start date, department, manager. They'll assign a desk and make sure it's set up with a chair, phone, basic office supplies. Sometimes there's no desk available right away, especially if we're hiring a lot of people at once, and then the new hire has to either wait for a space or temporarily sit in a conference room, which is not ideal.

Interviewer: How often does that happen?

Michelle: The no-desk-available thing? Maybe once every couple months. We're growing fast and sometimes our office space doesn't keep up. It's awkward though.

Interviewer: So IT and Facilities have been notified. What other pre-work needs to happen?

Michelle: I need to schedule their orientation session. We do new hire orientation every other Monday at 9 AM. It's a half-day session where we go over company policies, benefits, culture, all that stuff. I add them to the calendar invite and also assign them the pre-orientation checklist in Workday. That checklist has things like setting up direct deposit, adding emergency contacts, choosing a benefits plan, signing the employee handbook acknowledgment. They're supposed to complete all of that before their first day, but honestly, half of them don't. They either forget or they're busy wrapping up their old job. So we end up chasing them down on their first day or first week to finish the paperwork, and that slows everything down.

Interviewer: What happens on the actual first day? Walk me through that.

Michelle: Okay, so on their first day, they usually arrive around 9 AM. If there's a new hire orientation that day, they start with that. If not - if their start date doesn't line up with an orientation Monday - they go straight to their desk, meet their manager, and do desk-level orientation, and then they have to wait for the next orientation session, which could be up to two weeks away. It's not great because they miss important information at the start.

The manager is supposed to give them a first-day welcome, introduce them to the team, show them around the office, go over their initial responsibilities. But the managers are all over the place in terms of how prepared they are. Some managers have a whole structured first-week plan. Other managers are like "oh, you're starting today? Uh, let me figure out what you should do." It's really inconsistent.

Interviewer: That sounds like another pain point - the inconsistency in manager preparation.

Michelle: It is. We've tried to create first-day and first-week checklists for managers, but getting them to actually use them is another story. People are busy, they forget, they think they know what to do. But then the new hire has a bad experience because they're sitting around with nothing to do, or they don't know where the bathroom is, or they didn't get lunch plans, little things that make them feel unwelcome.

Interviewer: So the first day happens - with varying degrees of success. What about IT account setup? When does that happen?

Michelle: IT is supposed to have everything ready by first day. So the new hire should be able to log in on day one with their username and password - which IT emails them the day before - and have access to email, the company intranet, Slack, and any department-specific systems their manager requested. But again, sometimes IT doesn't get it all done in time. Maybe they didn't get the request early enough, or maybe there's a licensing issue, or maybe a specific system requires manager approval and the manager didn't respond. So the new hire shows up and can't log into stuff. They're just sitting there waiting for IT to troubleshoot. That happens maybe 15-20% of the time.

Interviewer: That's a significant percentage. What's the impact?

Michelle: It's really bad for morale. The person is excited to start their new job and they can't even access their email. They feel like we're not organized. And it wastes their time and the manager's time. Sometimes the manager just sends them home early if IT can't fix it that day and tells them to come back tomorrow. Not a great start.

Interviewer: What other activities happen in that first week?

Michelle: In the first week, they should be completing any remaining paperwork from the checklist, attending orientation if they haven't already, meeting with their manager for a formal check-in, and starting to get trained on their actual job responsibilities. The manager is supposed to assign them a buddy or mentor for the first 30 days, someone they can ask questions without feeling dumb. Some managers do this, some don't.

We also enroll them in any required training. Like everyone has to do compliance training on anti-harassment, data security, code of conduct, that kind of thing. Those are online modules in our learning management system. Plus there might be role-specific training, like if you're in sales you have training on the CRM, if you're in customer service you have training on our ticketing system. I coordinate with the managers to make sure people get enrolled, but it's all pretty manual. I have to send emails, track who's done what, follow up. We don't have a good automated system for that.

Interviewer: It sounds like there's a lot of manual coordination and follow-up.

Michelle: Oh yeah. I feel like I'm constantly sending reminder emails. "Has the new hire completed their paperwork? Has the manager scheduled the 1-on-1? Has IT finished the account setup? Has the new hire completed their compliance training?" It's a lot of tracking and chasing. I probably spend half my time just following up on things that should have happened automatically or by a certain deadline but didn't.

Interviewer: Is there any kind of formal check-in after the first week or first month?

Michelle: Yes, we're supposed to do a 30-day check-in. I send a calendar invite to the new hire, their manager, and myself. It's a three-way meeting where we discuss how the first month went, if there are any issues, if the new hire needs any additional support or resources. It's also a chance for the manager to give early feedback. That usually goes pretty well when it happens. But sometimes managers cancel it because they're too busy, or they say "oh we don't need to meet, everything's fine," and then later we find out the new hire is struggling or unhappy. So consistency is an issue there too.

Interviewer: What would you say are the biggest challenges or pain points in this onboarding process?

Michelle: I think the biggest one is the lack of coordination and automation. Everything is so manual and email-based. I'm sending emails to IT, to Facilities, to managers, to new hires. I'm tracking everything in my head or in a spreadsheet. There's no centralized system that says "here's what's done, here's what's pending, here's what's overdue." So things fall through the cracks.

Second is the inconsistency from managers. Some are great at onboarding, some are terrible. And the new hire experience suffers because of that.

Third is equipment delays for remote employees. We really need to get better at ordering equipment early and tracking shipments.

Fourth is IT account setup delays. 15-20% failure rate on day one is way too high.

And lastly, people not completing their pre-orientation checklist on time means we're chasing paperwork during their first week when they should be focusing on learning their job.

Interviewer: If you could fix one thing, what would it be?

Michelle: Probably the centralized tracking and automation. If we had a system that automatically notified IT and Facilities when a new hire was added, tracked all the tasks and their statuses, sent automatic reminders, and gave managers a clear checklist to follow, that would eliminate so much manual work and so many things falling through the cracks. That would be a game-changer.

Interviewer: That makes a lot of sense. Is there anything else I should know about the onboarding process?

Michelle: Just that we onboard probably 15 to 20 people a month right now with our growth rate, and it's only me doing the coordination. So that's why I'm so stretched thin and why things get missed sometimes. If the volume keeps growing, we either need more HR staff or we need better systems, or both.

Interviewer: Understood. Well, thank you so much for your time, Michelle. This has been really helpful.

Michelle: You're welcome. I hope it helps make onboarding better!
