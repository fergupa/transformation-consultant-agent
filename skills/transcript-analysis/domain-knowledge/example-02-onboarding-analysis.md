# Process Analysis: Employee Onboarding Process

## Executive Summary
The employee onboarding process begins with offer acceptance and includes background verification, HRIS setup, IT/facilities coordination, orientation scheduling, and 30-day check-ins. The process handles 15-20 new hires monthly with a single HR Coordinator managing all coordination, relying heavily on manual email-based communication and tracking, with significant inconsistency in execution quality.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Receive Signed Offer Letter
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator (Michelle), New Hire
- **Description**: HR receives the signed offer letter from candidate, confirming they will join the company
- **Input**: Candidate acceptance of offer
- **Output**: Confirmed start date and new hire commitment
- **Duration/Timing**: Ideally 2 weeks before start date, sometimes less
- **Pain Points**: Sometimes inadequate lead time when candidates need to start quickly

### Step 2: Initiate Background Check
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, CheckPoint (third-party service)
- **Description**: Log into CheckPoint portal and enter candidate information (name, DOB, SSN, previous addresses) to submit background check request
- **Input**: Signed offer letter and candidate personal information
- **Output**: Background check request submitted
- **Duration/Timing**: 3-5 business days turnaround, sometimes longer for multi-state candidates
- **Pain Points**: Extended timelines for candidates who lived in multiple states

### Step 3: Review Background Check Results
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, HR Director, Hiring Manager
- **Description**: Review returned background check results; if clean, proceed with onboarding; if issues arise, escalate to HR Director and hiring manager to decide whether to proceed, rescind offer, or request more information
- **Input**: Background check results from CheckPoint
- **Output**: Decision to proceed or not
- **Duration/Timing**: Depends on whether issues are found
- **Pain Points**: Issues require escalation and delay (occurs approximately 1 in 20 hires)

### Step 4: Create Employee Record in HRIS
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Enter new hire into Workday HRIS with all basic information: name, contact info, start date, job title, department, manager name, employment type (full-time, part-time, contractor); employee ID auto-generated by system
- **Input**: New hire information
- **Output**: Employee record created in Workday with assigned employee ID
- **Duration/Timing**: Done immediately after submitting background check, not waiting for results
- **Pain Points**: None mentioned

### Step 5: Notify IT for Account and Equipment Setup
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, IT Department
- **Description**: Send email to helpdesk@company.com with new hire details (name, start date, department, manager, remote vs on-site status) requesting account creation and equipment provisioning
- **Input**: Employee record information and work location
- **Output**: IT request submitted
- **Duration/Timing**: Should be done 10+ days before start date for remote employees
- **Pain Points**: Manual email process; no automated workflow; timing critical for remote employees to ensure equipment arrives on time

### Step 6: Equipment Provisioning
- **Actor/Role**: IT Department, New Hire
- **Description**: IT provisions equipment based on work location: on-site employees receive laptop (monitor/keyboard/mouse/docking picked up on first day); remote employees receive shipped full setup (laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, docking, headset, desk chair if needed)
- **Input**: IT request from Step 5
- **Output**: Equipment prepared/shipped
- **Duration/Timing**: Requires 10+ days for remote shipments
- **Pain Points**: 1 in 10 remote hires experience equipment delays due to late ordering, shipping delays, or items out of stock; requires expensive overnight shipping to resolve; creates terrible first impression

### Step 7: Notify Facilities for Workspace Assignment
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, Facilities Department
- **Description**: For on-site employees only, send email to facilities@company.com with new hire details (name, start date, department, manager) requesting desk assignment and setup with chair, phone, office supplies
- **Input**: Employee record information
- **Output**: Workspace assignment request submitted
- **Duration/Timing**: Before start date
- **Pain Points**: Occasionally no desk available (every couple months) due to rapid growth exceeding office space; new hire must temporarily use conference room, which is awkward

### Step 8: Schedule New Hire Orientation
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Add new hire to new hire orientation calendar invite; orientation occurs every other Monday at 9 AM as a half-day session covering company policies, benefits, and culture
- **Input**: New hire start date
- **Output**: Calendar invite sent, new hire added to orientation session
- **Duration/Timing**: Half-day session, every other Monday at 9 AM
- **Pain Points**: If start date doesn't align with orientation Monday, new hire misses important information and must wait up to 2 weeks for next session; some start with desk-level orientation only, which is inadequate

### Step 9: Assign Pre-Orientation Checklist
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, New Hire
- **Description**: Assign pre-orientation checklist in Workday with tasks: set up direct deposit, add emergency contacts, choose benefits plan, sign employee handbook acknowledgment; supposed to be completed before first day
- **Input**: Employee record in Workday
- **Output**: Checklist assigned to new hire
- **Duration/Timing**: Should be completed before first day
- **Pain Points**: 50% of new hires don't complete checklist on time; they're busy wrapping up old job or forget; results in chasing paperwork during first day/week, slowing down onboarding

### Step 10: First Day Arrival and Welcome
- **Actor/Role**: New Hire, Hiring Manager, HR Coordinator
- **Description**: New hire arrives around 9 AM; attends new hire orientation if scheduled that day, otherwise goes to desk for manager welcome and desk-level orientation; manager provides welcome, team introductions, office tour, initial responsibility overview
- **Input**: New hire arrival
- **Output**: New hire welcomed and oriented
- **Duration/Timing**: First day, typically 9 AM start
- **Pain Points**: Highly inconsistent manager preparation - some have structured first-week plans, others are unprepared ("oh, you're starting today?"); inconsistency creates poor experience with new hires sitting idle, not knowing basic information, feeling unwelcome; manager checklists exist but aren't consistently used

### Step 11: IT Account Access Setup
- **Actor/Role**: IT Department, New Hire
- **Description**: IT provides username and password via email (sent day before start); new hire should have access to email, company intranet, Slack, and department-specific systems on day one
- **Input**: IT request from Step 5, manager approval for specific systems
- **Output**: Account access credentials and system provisioning
- **Duration/Timing**: Should be ready by day one
- **Pain Points**: 15-20% failure rate - accounts not ready on day one due to late requests, licensing issues, or missing manager approvals; new hire cannot access email or systems, wastes time waiting for IT troubleshooting, sometimes sent home early; very bad for morale

### Step 12: First Week Activities
- **Actor/Role**: New Hire, Hiring Manager, HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Complete remaining paperwork from checklist, attend orientation if not done on day one, formal manager check-in, buddy/mentor assignment (supposed to happen, doesn't always), begin job responsibility training
- **Input**: Onboarded employee
- **Output**: Paperwork completed, initial training started
- **Duration/Timing**: First week
- **Pain Points**: Buddy/mentor assignment inconsistent across managers; significant time spent completing paperwork that should have been done pre-start

### Step 13: Training Enrollment
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, New Hire, Hiring Manager
- **Description**: Enroll new hire in required compliance training (anti-harassment, data security, code of conduct) via online learning management system modules; also coordinate role-specific training (CRM for sales, ticketing system for customer service, etc.)
- **Input**: New hire role and department
- **Output**: Training enrollments completed
- **Duration/Timing**: First week
- **Pain Points**: Highly manual process - HR sends emails to coordinate with managers, tracks completion manually, sends follow-up reminders; no automated system for tracking training completion

### Step 14: 30-Day Check-In Meeting
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, New Hire, Hiring Manager
- **Description**: Three-way meeting to discuss first month experience, identify any issues, assess if additional support/resources needed, and provide early manager feedback to new hire
- **Input**: Completed first 30 days
- **Output**: Documented check-in and any action items
- **Duration/Timing**: 30 days after start date
- **Pain Points**: Sometimes managers cancel due to being too busy or claim "everything's fine" without meeting, then later discover new hire is struggling or unhappy; inconsistent execution

## Decision Points

### Decision Point 1: Background Check Results
- **Location in Process**: After Step 2 (Background Check Completion)
- **Condition**: Whether background check results are clean or contain issues
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Path A**: Clean results (approximately 19 out of 20) → Proceed with onboarding
  - **Path B**: Issues found (approximately 1 out of 20) → Escalate to HR Director and hiring manager for decision on proceeding, rescinding, or requesting more information
- **Decision Maker**: Background check results; HR Director and hiring manager if escalated

### Decision Point 2: Employment Type
- **Location in Process**: Step 4 (Create Employee Record)
- **Condition**: Whether new hire is full-time employee or contractor
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Path A**: Full-time employee → Full onboarding package (benefits, laptop, workspace, full orientation)
  - **Path B**: Contractor → Limited setup (no benefits, may use own laptop, shorter orientation)
- **Decision Maker**: Hiring decision and offer terms

### Decision Point 3: Work Location
- **Location in Process**: Steps 5-7 (IT and Facilities Notifications)
- **Condition**: Whether new hire is remote or on-site
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Path A**: On-site → Laptop provided, other equipment picked up from IT room on first day; Facilities assigns workspace (Step 7)
  - **Path B**: Remote → Full equipment setup shipped to home address; no Facilities notification needed (skip Step 7)
- **Decision Maker**: Role requirements and offer terms

### Decision Point 4: Orientation Schedule Alignment
- **Location in Process**: Step 10 (First Day Arrival)
- **Condition**: Whether start date coincides with orientation Monday or not
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Path A**: Start date is orientation Monday → Attend orientation on first day, then meet manager
  - **Path B**: Start date is not orientation Monday → Desk-level orientation only, wait up to 2 weeks for formal orientation session
- **Decision Maker**: Start date timing relative to biweekly orientation schedule

## Pain Points and Inefficiencies

### Critical Issues

1. **Manual Email-Based Coordination**: Entire process relies on manual emails to IT, Facilities, managers, and new hires; no centralized tracking system
   - **Impact**: Things fall through the cracks; no visibility into what's done, pending, or overdue; HR spends half their time sending follow-up emails
   - **Frequency**: Every new hire (15-20 per month)
   - **Affected Steps**: Steps 5, 7, 13, and general coordination

2. **Equipment Delays for Remote Employees**: 1 in 10 remote hires experience equipment delays
   - **Impact**: Terrible first impression; employee cannot start work; requires expensive overnight shipping; waste of time for employee and manager
   - **Frequency**: 10% of remote hires
   - **Affected Steps**: Step 6

3. **IT Account Setup Failures**: 15-20% of new hires don't have working accounts on day one
   - **Impact**: Cannot access email or systems; waste of time waiting for IT; sometimes sent home early; very bad for morale and first impression
   - **Frequency**: 15-20% of new hires
   - **Affected Steps**: Step 11

4. **Inconsistent Manager Preparation**: Manager onboarding quality varies dramatically from well-structured plans to complete unpreparedness
   - **Impact**: Poor new hire experience; employees sitting idle, not knowing basics, feeling unwelcome; manager checklists exist but aren't used
   - **Frequency**: Significant percentage, not quantified
   - **Affected Steps**: Step 10, 12

5. **Pre-Orientation Checklist Not Completed**: 50% of new hires don't complete checklist before start date
   - **Impact**: HR chases paperwork during first day/week when employee should focus on learning job; slows down onboarding
   - **Frequency**: 50% of new hires
   - **Affected Steps**: Step 9, carried into Steps 10-12

6. **Manual Training Enrollment and Tracking**: No automated system for enrolling in training or tracking completion
   - **Impact**: HR sends manual emails, tracks in spreadsheets, sends follow-up reminders; time-consuming and error-prone
   - **Frequency**: Every new hire
   - **Affected Steps**: Step 13

### Inefficiencies

1. **Workspace Availability Issues**: Occasional desk unavailability forces new hires to temporarily work from conference rooms
   - **Current State**: Office space growth lags hiring growth
   - **Impact**: Awkward situation, unprofessional appearance
   - **Frequency**: Every couple months

2. **Orientation Schedule Misalignment**: New hires starting on non-orientation weeks miss important information and wait up to 2 weeks
   - **Current State**: Orientation only every other Monday
   - **Impact**: New hires miss critical information at start; inadequate desk-level orientation as substitute

3. **30-Day Check-In Cancellations**: Managers sometimes cancel or skip 30-day check-ins claiming everything is fine
   - **Current State**: Inconsistent execution of important milestone
   - **Impact**: Miss early opportunity to identify struggling or unhappy new hires

4. **Single Point of Failure**: One HR Coordinator handles all coordination for 15-20 new hires monthly
   - **Current State**: No backup or additional resources as volume grows
   - **Impact**: HR stretched thin, things get missed, scalability concern

5. **No Automated Notifications**: Adding new hire to Workday doesn't automatically trigger IT and Facilities workflows
   - **Current State**: Manual emails required for each department
   - **Impact**: Delays, potential for forgotten notifications

## Notes and Observations

- Process focused on full-time employees; contractors receive abbreviated onboarding
- Critical timing requirement: 10+ days lead time needed for remote employee equipment shipping
- Background check must be initiated immediately; doesn't wait for results before proceeding with other setup steps
- Biweekly orientation schedule creates unavoidable timing mismatches for many new hires
- Manager checklists and best practices exist but aren't enforced or consistently followed
- Buddy/mentor program exists in theory but execution depends entirely on individual managers
- HR Coordinator personally manages all aspects with no automation or workflow tools beyond basic HRIS
- Growing volume (15-20/month) with single coordinator indicates scalability challenge
- First day experience quality highly dependent on manager preparation and IT readiness
- No centralized dashboard or tracking system - HR relies on memory and spreadsheets
- If one improvement had to be prioritized, HR identified centralized tracking and automation as having highest impact (eliminate manual work, reduce dropped tasks, provide visibility, guide managers with automated checklists)
- Process pain points cluster around: lack of automation, inconsistent execution, manual tracking, and coordination delays
- Both technology gaps (no workflow automation) and people/process gaps (manager inconsistency) contribute to challenges
