# Process Analysis: Employee Onboarding Process

## Executive Summary
The employee onboarding process begins when a signed offer letter is received and encompasses background checks, system setup, equipment provisioning, workspace assignment, orientation, and first-month integration. The process is coordinated by an HR Coordinator (Michelle Rodriguez) and involves multiple departments including IT, Facilities, and hiring managers, with significant manual coordination via email and high variability in execution quality.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Receive Signed Offer Letter
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: HR Coordinator receives signed offer letter from candidate, confirming their acceptance of employment
- **Input**: Signed offer letter from candidate
- **Output**: Official confirmation that candidate is joining; trigger to begin onboarding activities
- **Duration/Timing**: Ideally 2 weeks before start date, sometimes less if candidate needs to start quickly
- **Pain Points**: Sometimes insufficient lead time if candidate needs to start quickly

### Step 2: Initiate Background Check
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: HR Coordinator logs into CheckPoint (third-party background check service) portal and enters candidate information including name, date of birth, social security number, and previous addresses, then submits background check request
- **Input**: Signed offer letter (from Step 1), candidate personal information
- **Output**: Submitted background check request
- **Duration/Timing**: 3 to 5 business days for results (sometimes longer if candidate has lived in multiple states or if there are issues)
- **Pain Points**: Variable completion time; delays occur when candidate has lived in multiple states or when issues are found

### Step 3: Background Check Review and Decision
- **Actor/Role**: HR Director, Hiring Manager (for escalations); HR Coordinator (for clean results)
- **Description**: Review background check results; if issues are found (approximately 1 in 20 cases), escalate to HR Director and hiring manager to decide whether to move forward, rescind offer, or request more information; if clean, proceed with onboarding
- **Input**: Background check results from CheckPoint
- **Output**: Decision to proceed with onboarding, rescind offer, or request additional information
- **Duration/Timing**: Not specified for review time
- **Pain Points**: Escalation process required for problematic results (though infrequent at ~5% of hires)

### Step 4: Create Employee Record in HRIS
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Create new hire's employee record in Workday (HRIS system) by entering basic information including name, personal contact info, start date, job title, department, manager name, and employment type (full-time, part-time, contractor); employee ID number is auto-generated by Workday
- **Input**: Candidate information, offer details
- **Output**: Employee record in Workday with auto-generated employee ID
- **Duration/Timing**: Performed immediately after submitting background check (does not wait for results)
- **Pain Points**: None mentioned for this specific step

### Step 5: Notify IT for Account and Equipment Setup
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Send email to IT helpdesk (helpdesk@company.com) with new hire details including name, start date, department, manager, and location status (remote or on-site) to request account setup and equipment provisioning
- **Input**: Employee record information from Workday
- **Output**: Email request sent to IT
- **Duration/Timing**: Must be sent at least 10 days before start date for remote employees to ensure timely equipment delivery
- **Pain Points**: Email-based manual process; timing critical for remote employees; equipment delays occur in approximately 1 in 10 remote hires due to late ordering, shipping delays, or stock shortages; requires emergency overnight shipping when delays occur, increasing costs

### Step 6: Equipment Provisioning (On-site vs Remote)
- **Actor/Role**: IT Department
- **Description**: For on-site employees: IT sends laptop; employee picks up monitor, keyboard, mouse, and docking station from IT equipment room on first day. For remote employees: IT ships complete setup including laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, docking station, headset, and desk chair (if needed)
- **Input**: IT setup request from Step 5
- **Output**: Equipment ready for on-site pickup or shipped to remote employee
- **Duration/Timing**: On-site equipment available day one; remote equipment requires lead time (minimum 10 days recommended)
- **Pain Points**: Approximately 10% of remote hires experience equipment delays due to late ordering, shipping delays, or items out of stock; creates poor first impression and requires expensive overnight shipping to remedy

### Step 7: Notify Facilities for Workspace Assignment
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Send email to Facilities (facilities@company.com) with new hire information including name, start date, department, and manager to request workspace assignment; applies to on-site employees only
- **Input**: Employee record information for on-site employees
- **Output**: Email request sent to Facilities
- **Duration/Timing**: Not specified
- **Pain Points**: Email-based manual process

### Step 8: Workspace Setup
- **Actor/Role**: Facilities Department
- **Description**: Assign desk to new hire and set up workspace with chair, phone, and basic office supplies
- **Input**: Workspace assignment request from Step 7
- **Output**: Assigned and equipped workspace
- **Duration/Timing**: Should be ready by start date
- **Pain Points**: Desk unavailability occurs approximately once every couple months during high-volume hiring; forces new hires to wait for space or temporarily sit in conference rooms; attributed to fast company growth outpacing office space

### Step 9: Schedule Orientation Session
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Add new hire to new hire orientation calendar invite; orientations are held every other Monday at 9 AM as half-day sessions covering company policies, benefits, and culture
- **Input**: Employee start date
- **Output**: New hire added to orientation calendar invite
- **Duration/Timing**: Half-day session (approximately 4 hours); occurs every other Monday
- **Pain Points**: If start date doesn't align with orientation Monday, new hire must wait up to two weeks for orientation and misses important information at the start

### Step 10: Assign Pre-Orientation Checklist
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: Assign pre-orientation checklist in Workday containing tasks including setting up direct deposit, adding emergency contacts, choosing benefits plan, and signing employee handbook acknowledgment; new hires are expected to complete before first day
- **Input**: Employee record in Workday
- **Output**: Assigned checklist in Workday
- **Duration/Timing**: To be completed before first day
- **Pain Points**: Approximately 50% of new hires don't complete the checklist on time due to forgetting or being busy at previous job; requires chasing paperwork during first day or first week, slowing down onboarding

### Step 11: IT Account Setup Completion
- **Actor/Role**: IT Department
- **Description**: Set up new hire accounts including username, password, email, company intranet, Slack, and department-specific systems as requested by manager; send login credentials to new hire one day before start date
- **Input**: IT setup request from Step 5, manager-requested system access
- **Output**: Active user accounts and credentials
- **Duration/Timing**: Should be completed by day before start date; credentials emailed one day before
- **Pain Points**: Failure rate of 15-20% on day one due to insufficient lead time, licensing issues, or pending manager approvals for specific systems; new hires cannot access email or systems, creating poor first impression and wasted time; sometimes results in new hire being sent home early

### Step 12: First Day Arrival
- **Actor/Role**: New Hire, Manager
- **Description**: New hire arrives (typically around 9 AM); if first day coincides with orientation Monday, attends orientation; if not, proceeds to desk for manager-led orientation and must wait up to two weeks for formal orientation session
- **Input**: Completed pre-work (ideally), workspace assignment, IT credentials
- **Output**: New hire present and beginning first day activities
- **Duration/Timing**: Arrival around 9 AM
- **Pain Points**: Inconsistent experience based on whether start date aligns with orientation schedule; if misaligned, new hire waits up to two weeks for formal orientation and misses important information

### Step 13: Manager First-Day Welcome and Orientation
- **Actor/Role**: Hiring Manager
- **Description**: Manager provides first-day welcome, introduces new hire to team, shows them around office, and explains initial responsibilities
- **Input**: New hire arrival
- **Output**: Team introductions, office tour, initial job overview
- **Duration/Timing**: First day
- **Pain Points**: Highly inconsistent quality of manager preparation; some managers have structured first-week plans while others are unprepared and leave new hires without direction; HR has created first-day and first-week checklists for managers but adoption is poor due to managers being busy, forgetting, or believing they know what to do; results in new hires sitting idle, not knowing basic information like bathroom locations, or missing lunch plans

### Step 14: Buddy/Mentor Assignment
- **Actor/Role**: Hiring Manager
- **Description**: Manager assigns new hire a buddy or mentor for first 30 days who can answer questions
- **Input**: New hire's first day/week
- **Output**: Assigned buddy/mentor
- **Duration/Timing**: First 30 days
- **Pain Points**: Inconsistent implementation - some managers assign buddies, others don't

### Step 15: Complete Remaining Pre-Orientation Paperwork
- **Actor/Role**: New Hire, HR Coordinator
- **Description**: New hire completes any remaining items from pre-orientation checklist that weren't finished before first day; HR Coordinator follows up as needed
- **Input**: Incomplete checklist items from Step 10
- **Output**: Completed paperwork (direct deposit, emergency contacts, benefits, handbook acknowledgment)
- **Duration/Timing**: First day or first week
- **Pain Points**: Approximately 50% of new hires have incomplete checklists requiring follow-up; diverts attention from learning job responsibilities

### Step 16: Compliance Training Enrollment
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, New Hire
- **Description**: HR Coordinator enrolls new hire in required compliance training modules (anti-harassment, data security, code of conduct) via learning management system; new hire completes online modules
- **Input**: Employee record
- **Output**: Enrolled and completed compliance training
- **Duration/Timing**: First week
- **Pain Points**: Manual enrollment process; HR must track completion and send follow-up emails

### Step 17: Role-Specific Training Enrollment
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, Hiring Manager, New Hire
- **Description**: HR Coordinator works with manager to identify and enroll new hire in role-specific training (e.g., CRM training for sales, ticketing system training for customer service); new hire completes training
- **Input**: Role requirements, manager input
- **Output**: Enrolled and completed role-specific training
- **Duration/Timing**: First week and ongoing
- **Pain Points**: Manual coordination between HR and managers; no automated system; requires emails and tracking of completion status

### Step 18: First Week Manager Check-in
- **Actor/Role**: Hiring Manager, New Hire
- **Description**: Manager conducts formal check-in meeting with new hire during first week
- **Input**: First week experience
- **Output**: Early feedback exchange, identification of support needs
- **Duration/Timing**: Within first week
- **Pain Points**: Inconsistent implementation across managers

### Step 19: 30-Day Check-in Meeting
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator, Hiring Manager, New Hire
- **Description**: Three-way meeting to discuss first month experience, identify any issues, assess if new hire needs additional support or resources, and provide manager feedback
- **Input**: 30 days of employment experience
- **Output**: Assessment of onboarding success, identification of issues, action items for support
- **Duration/Timing**: 30 days after start date
- **Pain Points**: Managers sometimes cancel due to being too busy or claim meeting isn't needed; later discover new hire is struggling or unhappy; inconsistent execution

### Step 20: Ongoing Follow-up and Tracking
- **Actor/Role**: HR Coordinator
- **Description**: HR Coordinator continuously follows up via email on pending tasks including paperwork completion, manager 1-on-1 scheduling, IT account setup completion, and compliance training completion
- **Input**: Status of various onboarding tasks
- **Output**: Reminder emails, status updates
- **Duration/Timing**: Ongoing throughout onboarding period
- **Pain Points**: HR Coordinator spends approximately 50% of time sending follow-up emails on tasks that should have happened automatically or by deadline; manual tracking in head or spreadsheet with no centralized system showing completed, pending, or overdue tasks; things fall through the cracks

## Pain Points and Inefficiencies

### Critical Issues

1. **Lack of Centralized Tracking and Automation**: No centralized system to track onboarding task status (completed, pending, overdue)
   - **Impact**: HR Coordinator spends ~50% of time sending manual follow-up emails; tasks fall through the cracks; no visibility into bottlenecks
   - **Frequency**: Continuous, affects every new hire (15-20 hires per month)
   - **Affected Steps**: All steps, especially Step 20 (Ongoing follow-up and tracking)

2. **IT Account Setup Failure Rate**: 15-20% of new hires cannot access systems on day one
   - **Impact**: Poor first impression; wasted time for new hire and manager; sometimes new hire sent home early; delays productivity
   - **Frequency**: 15-20% of hires (approximately 3-4 per month at current volume)
   - **Affected Steps**: Step 11 (IT Account Setup), Step 12 (First Day Arrival)

3. **Remote Equipment Delivery Delays**: Approximately 10% of remote hires experience equipment delays
   - **Impact**: Equipment arrives late or not at all on first day; poor first impression; requires expensive overnight shipping; delays productivity
   - **Frequency**: ~10% of remote hires
   - **Affected Steps**: Steps 5-6 (IT notification and equipment provisioning)

4. **Manager Preparation Inconsistency**: Highly variable quality of manager onboarding execution
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent new hire experience; some new hires left without direction, missing basic information, or sitting idle; affects engagement and retention
   - **Frequency**: Ongoing issue affecting significant portion of new hires
   - **Affected Steps**: Steps 13-14, 18 (Manager first-day welcome, buddy assignment, first-week check-in)

5. **Pre-Orientation Checklist Non-Completion**: 50% of new hires don't complete checklist before first day
   - **Impact**: Time wasted chasing paperwork during first week when new hire should be learning job; slows onboarding process
   - **Frequency**: ~50% of hires (approximately 7-10 per month)
   - **Affected Steps**: Steps 10, 15 (Assign checklist, complete remaining paperwork)

### Inefficiencies

1. **Manual Email-Based Coordination**: All inter-department coordination via individual emails
   - **Current State**: HR sends separate emails to IT helpdesk, Facilities, managers; no automated workflows
   - **Impact**: Time-consuming; risk of emails being missed or delayed; no automated tracking

2. **Orientation Scheduling Misalignment**: Orientation only offered every other Monday
   - **Current State**: If start date doesn't align with orientation Monday, new hire waits up to two weeks for formal orientation
   - **Impact**: New hires miss critical information at start; inconsistent first-week experience
   - **Frequency**: Approximately 50% of hires (those not starting on orientation Monday)

3. **Workspace Availability Issues**: Periodic desk shortages for on-site employees
   - **Current State**: Fast company growth outpaces office space planning
   - **Impact**: New hires forced to wait for workspace or sit temporarily in conference rooms; unprofessional first impression
   - **Frequency**: Approximately once every couple months

4. **Training Enrollment Process**: Manual coordination for compliance and role-specific training
   - **Current State**: HR manually enrolls each new hire; manually tracks completion; sends follow-up emails
   - **Impact**: Time-consuming; tracking gaps; delays in completion
   - **Frequency**: Every new hire

5. **30-Day Check-in Cancellations**: Managers cancel or skip 30-day check-ins
   - **Current State**: Managers cancel because too busy or believe it's unnecessary
   - **Impact**: Issues with struggling or unhappy new hires discovered too late
   - **Frequency**: Not specified, but noted as recurring issue

6. **Manager Checklist Non-Adoption**: Managers don't use provided first-day/first-week checklists
   - **Current State**: HR has created checklists but managers don't follow them
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent onboarding quality; poor new hire experiences
   - **Frequency**: Ongoing, affects significant portion of managers

7. **Single-Person Bottleneck**: Only one HR Coordinator handling 15-20 hires per month
   - **Current State**: Michelle Rodriguez coordinates all onboarding activities alone
   - **Impact**: Stretched thin; tasks get missed; risk as volume increases
   - **Frequency**: Continuous operational constraint

## Process Metrics
- **Total Steps**: 20 main process steps
- **Number of Decision Points**: 6
- **Number of Actors**: 7 (HR Coordinator, New Hire, HR Director, Hiring Manager, IT Department, Facilities Department, CheckPoint)
- **Identified Pain Points**: 12 (5 critical issues, 7 inefficiencies)
- **Manual Steps**: 18 (most steps involve manual coordination)
- **Systems Involved**: 12

## Notes and Observations

- **Current Volume**: 15-20 new hires per month with growth trajectory
- **Staffing Constraint**: Single HR Coordinator (Michelle Rodriguez) managing entire onboarding process; noted need for additional HR staff or better systems as volume increases
- **Process Variation by Employment Type**: Interview focused on full-time employee onboarding; contractor onboarding is abbreviated (no benefits, shorter orientation, sometimes BYOD)
- **Background Check Statistics**: ~95% of background checks come back clean; ~5% (1 in 20) require escalation
- **IT Setup Lead Time Requirement**: Minimum 10 days for remote employees to ensure equipment arrival
- **Orientation Schedule**: Half-day sessions every other Monday at 9 AM covering policies, benefits, and culture
- **Manager Preparation Gap**: While first-day and first-week checklists exist for managers, adoption is poor
- **Timing Sensitivity**: Multiple dependencies on lead time (background check, IT equipment for remote workers, workspace availability)
- **Follow-up Burden**: HR spends approximately 50% of time on manual follow-ups and tracking
- **System Integration Gap**: No integration between Workday, IT systems, Facilities, and training platforms
- **Key Improvement Opportunity**: Michelle identified centralized tracking and automation as the #1 improvement need - would eliminate manual work, prevent things from falling through cracks, and provide visibility
- **Equipment for Remote Workers**: Full setup includes laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, docking station, headset, and desk chair (if needed)
- **Escalation for Background Issues**: HR Director and Hiring Manager jointly decide on problematic background checks
- **Emergency Workarounds**: Overnight shipping used when equipment delayed (increased cost); new hires sometimes sent home when IT access unavailable
